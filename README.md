CS-255-H2974 System Analysis and Design

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? **

Driver’s pass was a project involving a fiction company looking to expand its drivers aid services into a digital format.

**What type of system did they want you to design? What did you do particularly well?**

They wanted a web based system that allowed client scheduling of private lessons with an instructor and as a part of the premium packages include private study materials and quizzes to practice for their drivers test. In this program we implemented a remote access calendar that could be updated by three different parties: the student, a staff aid called the scheduler as well as the drivers who could post. This created a similar uber style share system. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? **

I think I would revise my quiz section, I had alot of questions I would have liked to ask in a more real world scenario

**How would you improve it? **

I would have designed a more structure format for, open-ended, multiple choice and hints that would of guided how future staff members would of created the quizzes and that would allow immediate feedback for the users. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 
**

After reading the hypothetical conversation log between the product manager and the client. I interpreted a need that the user wanted it to run almost independently of the staff when possible. Staff job would be primarily to supplement and help fill in gaps in technology use. 

**Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? 
**
Its important because, if you can predict what the user will need. It’ll save crucial feedback time later down the line. The customer didn’t directly ask for a calendar but they did ask for a way to schedule reading the needs to see multiple items at once seemed vital in a scheduling independent of someone else with all the information. 

**How do you approach designing software? 
**

My approach to software design is to focus on the user, simplify the users core needs and direct that each is met in as simple and streamlined as possible. Once I’ve decided on the mechanism of that, I then focus on how I can be uphold the 4 principles of OOP while doing so. 

**What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
**

I think I’d get more feedback from other developers earlier, I discovered as the project went on I got feedback in later discussions. I found much better resolutions as the project went on, for example, I was initially thing that action logs should be limited to the admin role, a publicly visibility of that information would two fold have been better in more transparency and reduced workload on admins.
